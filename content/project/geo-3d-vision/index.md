summary: "Implemented different implicit representations for learning-based 3d
  point reconstruction and improved the performance of convolutional occupancy
  networks: 1) Dynamic plane position learning 2) Spherical coordinates 3)
  Dynamic position of spheres – “spherical cameras” surrounding object 4)
  Rotational matrix learning 5) Point plane net kernel"
